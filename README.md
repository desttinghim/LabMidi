Cross platform Midi IN and OUT. Standard midi file parser and player. 

Midi Softsynth implementation for OSX.

Thanks to ofxMidi for inspiration, and jasmid for a clean implementation of a standard MIDI file reader.

Tested on OSX. Implementation for Windows in place, but not tested. premake file needs to be set up for multiple platforms. Pull requests welcome.

See the MidiApp source for examples of usage.
